  <div class="entry-content"><p>Everytime we press a key in an <em>interactive</em> SSH session, the SSH Client
sends that keystroke as a TCP segment to the SSH Server. Here is a
Wireshark capture of I having SSH-ed into my own machine and pressing
a <em>single key</em>. I have not included packets indicating the setup and
teardown of the TCP and SSH connections.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ssh4packets.png">
<em>You can differentiate between the client and server from the
source and destination port numbers. SSH servers usually work on port 22.</em></p>

<p>After the client has transmitted a character over a TCP segment, the
server acknowledges that it has received it. Acknowledgements of data
enable TCP to provide a reliable transport service to higher level
protocols like HTTP, SMTP and SSH.</p>

<p>After this, the server actually processs the character by sending it
to the program, which is typically <code>bash</code>, but could be anything &#8211;
<code>sh</code>, <code>zsh</code> or even <code>emacs</code>. The shell will interpret the character
and send back the result over another TCP segment. This enables the
client to <em>echo</em> the character on the screen and send back an
acknowledgement to the server.</p>

<p>I have depicted this in a timeline &#8211;</p>

<p><img src="/images/sshtimeline.png" title="" ></p>

<h2>I tried this out and I can see only three segments per character I type</h2>

<p>To be minimal about the traffic that sending acknowledgements for data
causes, TCP piggybacks ACKs on data that it has to send anyway. This
is implementation specific, though if you were using the socket API,
you&#8217;d set the TCP_QUICKACK option to disable delayed acknowlegments.</p>

<p>Here is an example of this happening when I SSH-ed into an AWS EC2
server.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ssh3packets.png">
<em>Note that the server is sending the ACK to the character it received
and the response together in one TCP segment.</em></p>

<h2>Why not send whole commands?</h2>

<p>One may wonder why does SSH not transmit every command or every line
rather than sending individual characters. The
answer lies in the fact that the program on the server may
have commands that are only a character long, without requiring a
newline character. Think ESC in
<code>vi</code>, or M-x in <code>emacs</code>, or SPACE in <code>more</code>. Even while sending
commands to <code>bash</code>, there could be readline-specific keystrokes like
C-e or C-a or even TAB that need to be sent as they are pressed
instead of waiting for a newline.
So, SSH chooses not to try to understand what sequence of characters
constitute a command and simply sends across characters as they are
typed. In fact, it doesn&#8217;t even assume if and how the character
pressed will echo on the screen, it finds it out from the server program.</p>

<h2>What happens when I use SSH with other software like git?</h2>

<p>One the most frequent ways that I use SSH is when I do any remote
<code>git</code> operations like <code>pull</code>, <code>push</code>, or <code>clone</code>. When actual data is
being sent, the SSH software understands that it isn&#8217;t an interactive
invocation and TCP utilizes all the available capacity of a each
segment to help SSH send all that data.</p>

<p>Deciding the sizes of segments is left to TCP and would warrant a blog
post by itself, but here is a quick primer &#8211; The Maximum Segment Size (MSS) that TCP calculates
is such that there will be no IP layer fragmentation of segments. In
other words, TCP sets its MSS lesser than or equal to the Path MTU (Maximum
Transmission Unit). TCP also sets the Don&#8217;t Fragment (DF) Flag to
ensure that Segments don&#8217;t get fragmented on the IP.</p>

<p>Here is a capture of Wireshark sniffing data when I cloned a
repository from GitHub over SSH.</p>

<p><img src="/images/sshbulkdata.png">
<em>Note how the data in each segement plus the TCP and IP headers equal
the exact MTU of my Ethernet interface &#8211; 1500</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is actually very unlike a man page. It assumes that you know very little about
TCP/IP networking. It also deals with only the parameter-less
invocation of <code>ifconfig</code>, since other invocations are well documented
in the real man page.<br/>
You can read the sections independently of one another, skipping what
you already know. In this regard, it is quite like a man page.</p>

<h2>What is ifconfig?</h2>

<p><code>ifconfig</code> is a systems administration utility for UNIX-like systems
that allows for diagnosing and configuring network
interfaces. Although some claim that it is being replaced with <code>iproute2</code> (or simply the <code>ip</code> command), I
have seen it being used abundantly.<br/>
You can using <code>ifconfig</code> to bring up interfaces, turn them off, and configure
the protocols and identifiers they use.</p>

<h3>Why document it?</h3>

<p><code>ifconfig</code> prints out a wealth of information if invoked
without any parameters and options. I simply could not find the
definitions of most of these things and what follows
is my attempt at documenting these exhaustively.</p>

<hr />

<p>This is what we see when we invoke GNU <code>ifconfig</code> on a virtual host running
Ubuntu. Note the absence of a wifi interface, as is the case with most
servers.</p>

<pre><code>$ ifconfig
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 08:00:27:0c:49:47  
          inet addr:192.168.0.121  Bcast:192.168.0.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
          inet6 addr: fe80::a00:27ff:fe0c:4947/64 Scope:Link

          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 
          RX bytes:720 (720.0 B)  TX bytes:720 (720.0 B)
</code></pre>

<hr />

<h2>The Ethernet Interface</h2>

<pre><code>eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 08:00:27:0c:49:47  
</code></pre>

<p> Application data is progressively encapsulated as it descends through
 the layers of the TCP/IP Stack. <code>Link encap:Ethernet</code> means that IP
 Datagrams coming from the Internet layer will be wrapped in an Ethernet
 Frame before leaving this interface.</p>

<p><code>HWaddr 08:00:27:0c:49:47</code> is the 48 bit Media Access Control (MAC) address. It uniquely
 identifies this network interface on the hardware layer. This address
 will be sent in ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) reponse packets when other devices want to send
 Ethernet Frames to this interface.</p>

<h3>The IPv4 address</h3>

<pre><code>eth0      inet addr:192.168.0.121  Bcast:192.168.0.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
</code></pre>

<p> <code>inet addr:192.168.0.121</code> needs no introduction, it is the 32 bit IPv4 address that
 this interface is using. Wanting to know this address is also probably the most common reason
 for invoking <code>ifconfig</code>.</p>

<p> Modern networking relies on slicing networks
 into smaller portions using subnetting and Classless
 Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR).
 For subnetting to work, we need to understand what part of
 an IP address is the Network ID and what part is the Host ID. This
 information is carried in the Network Mask <code>Mask:255.255.255.0</code>.</p>

<p> <code>Bcast:192.168.0.255</code> is the broadcast address of the subnetwork the interface is
 on. Packets sent to this address will be received by all interfaces
 on this subnet.<br/>
 We get this the broadcast address by masking the IP Address with a
 bit complement of the network mask <code>Mask:255.255.255.0</code> like this &#8211;</p>

<pre><code>Network Mask:           255 . 255 . 255 .   0

Complement all bits:      0 .   0 .   0 . 255
Original IP address:    192 . 168 .   0 . 121
                        _____________________
OR them bitwise:        192 . 168 .   0 . 255
                        Which is the Broadcast Address
</code></pre>

<h3>Next, let&#8217;s go over the IPv6 address</h3>

<p>I never paid much attention to IPv6 addresses in the past. However, it
isn&#8217;t too complicated to get to the bottom of it. Your local IPv6
addresses are essentially based on the MAC address of the interface.</p>

<pre><code>eth0      inet6 addr: fe80::a00:27ff:fe0c:4947/64 Scope:Link
</code></pre>

<p><code>fe80::a00:27ff:fe0c:4947/64</code> is the 128 bit link-local IPv6 address
for the interface. We understand that it is a link-local address
because of the <code>Scope:Link</code> field. Link-local IPv6 addresses are for
communicating with the directly attached network, and not globally.</p>

<pre><code>This is how all link-local addresses are laid out:

10 bytes     | 54 bytes   | 64 bytes
1111 1110 10 | All Zeroes | Interface Identifier

Let's see whether our IPv6 address conforms to this pattern:

                fe80::a00:27ff:fe0c:4947

  (we replace :: with multiple all-zero double-octets)

      fe80:0000:0000:0000 : 0a00:27ff:fe0c:4947

           PREFIX         |   INTERFACE IDENTIFER
  All these zeroes make a | This looks a lot similiar
  link-local IPv6 address | to the MAC address which
  non-routable            | is '08:00:27:0c:49:47'
</code></pre>

<p>The Interface Identifier is in fact usually made up using the MAC
address. This is called EUI-64, or Extended Unique Indentifier by the IEEE.</p>

<pre><code>  08:00:27:0c:49:47        # Start with the MAC adress

  08:00:27:ff:fe:0c:49:47  # Insert ff:fe in the center
  0a:00:27:ff:fe:0c:49:47  # Invert the 7th MSB starting from the right

  0a00:27ff:fe0c:4947      # Group it into double octets!
</code></pre>

<h3>More about the interface</h3>

<pre><code> eth0     UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST MTU:1500  Metric:1
</code></pre>

<p><code>UP</code> means that network interface is activated (with address and routing
tables) and is accessible to the IP layer.<br/>
<code>BROADCAST</code> means that interface supports broadcasting (and can hence obtain
an IP address using DHCP).<br/>
<code>RUNNING</code> signifies that the network driver has been loaded and has
initialized the interface.<br/>
<code>MULTICAST</code> tells us that multicasting support is enabled on this
interface.<br/>
Since we didn&#8217;t invoke <code>ifconfig</code> with the <code>--all</code> flag, it will only
print out interfaces that are currently <code>UP</code>.</p>

<p><code>MTU 1500</code> shows that the current <code>Maximum Transmission Unit</code> is set to 1500 bytes, the largest
allowed over Ethernet. Any IP datagrams larger than 1500 bytes will be
fragmented into multiple Ethernet Frames, <em>if allowed</em> by the routers
and hosts in between. Else we&#8217;ll just get an ICMP <code>Destination
Unreachable</code> response with Code 4.</p>

<p>And finally, <code>Metric:1</code> is the cost associated with routing frames
over this interface. Normally, Linux kernels don&#8217;t build routing
tables based on metrics. This value is only present for
compatibility. If you do try to change the metric, it may not work. [1]</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo ifconfig eth0 metric 2
SIOCSIFMETRIC: Operation not supported
</code></pre>

<h3>Statistics</h3>

<pre><code>eth0      RX packets:3461 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:3686 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 
          RX bytes:1778710 (1.7 MB)  TX bytes:821363 (821.3 KB)
</code></pre>

<p><code>RX</code> stands for received and <code>TX</code> stands for transmitted.
Documentation for the fields that follow is sparse and only
long-deserted ghost-town forums popped up in my searches.
I download the source code for <code>GNU inetutils 1.9.1</code>
and here are my findings after a few recursive greps:<br/>
<code>RX packets</code>: total number of packets received.<br/>
<code>RX errors</code>: an aggregation of the total number of packets received
with errors. This includes too-long-frames errors, ring-buffer overflow errors, crc errors,
frame alignment errors, fifo overruns, and missed packets. <br/>
The ring-buffer refers to a buffer that the NIC transfers frames to before raising an IRQ with the
kernel.<br/>
The <code>RX overruns</code> field displays fifo overruns, which are
caused by the rate at which the ring-buffer is drained being higher
that the kernel being able to handle IO.
<code>RX frame</code> accounts for the incoming frames that were misaligned.</p>

<p><code>TX packets</code> indicate the total number of transmitted packets.<br/>
<code>TX errors</code> present a summation of errors encountered while
transmitting packets. This list includes errors due to the
transmission being aborted, errors due to the carrier, fifo errors,
heartbeat errors, and window errors. <em>This particular <code>struct</code> in the source code
isn&#8217;t commented.</em><br/>
We also have itemized error counts for <code>dropped</code>, <code>overruns</code>, and
<code>carrier</code>.<br/>
<code>collisions</code> is the number of transmissions terminated due to CSMA/CD
(Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection).</p>

<p>The final line is merely all successfully received and
transmitted data in bytes and a human readable format.</p>

<h3>Transmit Queue Length</h3>

<p>Since this isn&#8217;t a statistic, it gets its own heading.<br/>
The <code>txqueuelen</code> field displays the current Transmit
Queue Length.
This queue limits the number of frames in the interface&#8217;s device driver that are queued for
transmission.
The value of the <code>txqueuelen</code> can also be set by the <code>ifconfig</code> command.</p>

<h3>Interrupts</h3>

<pre><code>eth0      Interrupt:10 Base address:0xd020 
</code></pre>

<p><code>Interrupt:10</code> corresponds to the IRQ number against which to look up
the <code>eth0</code> device in <code>/proc/interrupts</code>, where the interrupts are counted.</p>

<pre><code>$ cat /proc/interrupts 
               CPU0       
      0:        115    XT-PIC-XT-PIC    timer
      1:       3402    XT-PIC-XT-PIC    i8042
      2:          0    XT-PIC-XT-PIC    cascade
      5:          1    XT-PIC-XT-PIC    snd_intel8x0
      8:          0    XT-PIC-XT-PIC    rtc0
      9:          0    XT-PIC-XT-PIC    acpi
=&gt;   10:      53981    XT-PIC-XT-PIC    eth0             &lt;=
     11:       1535    XT-PIC-XT-PIC    ohci_hcd:usb1
     12:        146    XT-PIC-XT-PIC    i8042
     14:      16923    XT-PIC-XT-PIC    ata_piix
     15:      10416    XT-PIC-XT-PIC    ata_piix
</code></pre>

<p><code>53981</code> is the number of times the <code>eth0</code> device has interrupted <code>CPU0</code>.<br/>
The third column tells the name of the programmable interrupt handler,
and <code>XT-PIC-XT-PIC</code> may be something that my VirtualBox is doing.</p>

<h2>The Loopback Interface</h2>

<pre><code>lo        Link encap:Local Loopback  
          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0
          inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host
          UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:16436  Metric:1
          RX packets:12 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:12 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 
          RX bytes:720 (720.0 B)  TX bytes:720 (720.0 B)
</code></pre>

<h3>The Loopback is not an Ethernet device.</h3>

<p>It isn&#8217;t connected to the NIC (or any hardware) and frames relayed over
the loopback don&#8217;t exit the host on any layer. It is fully implemented
in software. This also means that IP Datagrams sent over this
interface are not encapsulted in an Ethernet frame, as can be seen by
<code>Link encap:Local Loopback</code>.</p>

<h3>IPv4 Addressing</h3>

<pre><code>lo        inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0
</code></pre>

<p>We have a large address space as set by the liberal subnet mask &#8211;
<code>Mask:255.0.0.0</code>.
The loopback device can be configured with an IP address on the <code>127.0.0.0/8</code> subnetwork which can be any address between <code>127.0.0.1</code> to
<code>127.255.255.254</code>. The loopback address on my machine is <code>127.0.0.1</code>, which is usually the default.</p>

<h3>And the IPv6</h3>

<pre><code>lo        inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host
</code></pre>

<p>Unlike IPv4, only one address is reserved for the loopback interface in
the IPv6 address space &#8211; <code>0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1</code>. It represented more
succintly as <code>::1/128</code> since we can replace consecutive groups of <code>0</code>
by a <code>::</code>.<br/>
The IPv6 Scope for the loopback address <code>::1/128</code> and is treated under the
<code>link-local</code> scope in RFC 3513. The terminology <code>Scope:Host</code> or
<code>Scope:Node</code> is also used to further emphasize that the packet will never exit the host
(or node). Unlike other link-local addresses, if a packet addressed
<em>to</em> <code>::1/128</code> is received on an Ethernet interface, it is promptly dropped.</p>

<h3>The interface</h3>

<pre><code>lo        UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:16436  Metric:1
</code></pre>

<p>The eponymous <code>LOOPBACK</code> flag in the flags string isn&#8217;t as interesting
as the <code>MTU:16436</code>. Since the loopback interface isn&#8217;t bounded by the
physical limitations of Ethernet or FDDI, its MTU is set to more than
16KiB.<br/>
We can send a <code>16 x 1024 = 16384</code> byte data packet, with an additional
<code>52</code> bytes without fragmenting it. <code>52</code> bytes are usually sufficient
for TCP and IP headers (both are 20 bytes long without options).<br/>
The concept of <code>Metric</code> is the same as it was for Ethernet interface above.</p>

<h3>Statistics and Transmit Queue Length</h3>

<pre><code>lo        RX packets:12 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:12 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 
</code></pre>

<p>The fields for loopback statistics are printed out by the same
function and retain the same definitions from the Ethernet piece
above. However, errors and collisions have little chance of making an
appearance here, since there isn&#8217;t a physical medium present.<br/>
The <code>txqueuelen</code> is set to <code>0</code> by default. It can be changed for the
<code>lo</code> device, but I doubt if that would have any effect.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Other Tools</h2>

<p>Don&#8217;t like GNU <code>ifconfig</code> or don&#8217;t have it? No problem, there are a few other ways of
querying a system for similar information. <code>netstat -ai</code> and <code>ifconfig</code>  also work on Mac
OS X, but the output is slightly different since both tools originate
from the BSD userland.</p>

<p>With <code>iproute2</code> &#8211;</p>

<pre><code>$ ip --statistics link list

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While working on deploying a web-application recently, I needed to transfer a &#8216;build artifact&#8217; (fancy name for a <code>.tgz</code>) from a Continuous Integration server to an RPM repository server.</p>

<p>We already have an existing RPM repository server that uses Apache, and once my tarball was in the correct location, it would be available over HTTP for all to consume.</p>

<p>Cutting to the chase &#8211; <em>What is the simplest way by which I could automatically transfer a ~20 MiB file from one CentOS host to another?</em>
 I didn&#8217;t want to install an FTP server or any extra Apache module on the existing RPM host that would then support multi-part file uploads.</p>

<p>The quickest solution, it seemed was an <code>scp</code> or an <code>rsync</code>.</p>

<p>So, how would this CI host be authorized to open an SSH tunnel to the web-server?
 Where would the identity key reside? There is no elaborate keyserver in this ecosystem.</p>

<p>I decided to the transfer the responsibility of protecting the system from the identity key to the remote host&#8217;s operating system.</p>

<p>A new user called <em>tarballs</em> on the RPM repository host with its <code>HOME</code> set to <code>/var/www/html/tarballs</code>, and set its <code>SHELL</code> to <code>rbash</code>.</p>

<h3>What is rbash?</h3>

<p>When the bash is started with the name rbash (<code>ln -s /bin/bash /bin/rbash</code>) or by invoking bash like this: <code>bash -r</code>, it starts up in a restricted way, which is handy while setting up more controlled environments. I know of it thanks to Saurabh &#8216;Rob&#8217; Mookherjee, a sysadmin whom I work with.
 When in bash&#8217;s restricted mode, one cannot change directories, use commands with a <code>/</code> in them, neither can one change the <code>PATH</code> or the <code>SHELL</code> variables. A more comprehensive list of contraints can be found in the manpage for bash.</p>

<p>So, all is good except the <em>tarballs</em> user still has access to all executables that exist in its <code>PATH</code> that the system assigns by default.
 A quick hack in the <code>/etc/profile.d</code> to unset the <code>PATH</code> for the <em>tarballs</em> user and there is hardly anything the <em>tarballs</em> user can do once logged in.
 The only required executble binary was <code>/usr/bin/ln</code> to make a symlink called &#8216;latest&#8217; to the most recent tarball that was SCP&#8217;ed over.
 I copied this binary to <em>tarballs&#8217;</em> <code>HOME</code>. A kludge, I admit.</p>

<p>Now, from my Continuous Integration agent, I can script these two commands to be run everytime a new build artifact is to be uploaded to the repository.</p>

<pre><code>scp -v -i tarball_identity tmp/build7f3cd88.tar.gz tarballs@repo.host.com:  
ssh -v -i tarball_identity tarballs@repo.host.com "ln -sf build7f3cd88.tar.gz latest"
</code></pre>

<p>For reference, here is what I have on the repository host:</p>

<pre><code>[root@repo.host.com ~]# cat /etc/profile.d/tarballs.sh 
if [ `whoami` = 'tarballs' ]; then unset PATH; fi
</code></pre>

<p>In larger, more complicated systems that support different products and web-apps, I have seen the occasional file that is rsync&#8217;ed to another host, or a larger script residing remotely being invoked over SSH. While such things usually happen inside of a VPN or a DMZ, it is still a risky proposition to have an identity file being checked into the codebase or lying on an arbitrary host.
 While having a more robust security solution should certainly be on the list, creating a separate user on the remote host that has only enough privileges to perform a said task is a great idea.
 Once such a user exists, we have effectively moved that responsibility from the SSH identity keyfile to the remote host&#8217;s operating system.</p>

<p><em>Bear in mind that this infrastructure lies in a secure corporate datacenter with access to the machines restricted to trusted co-workers. Also, while the RPM repository host is important, all the data it holds can be easily mirrored and reproduced.
 Solely relying on an <code>rbash</code> is by no means a solution for any mission-critical host that is directly exposed to the internet or any untrusted zone.</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Almost everyone I know who writes any Ruby outside of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Ruby_Shell">irb REPL</a> uses Bundler.
And <em>everyone</em> I know uses RVM to manage their rubies and their gems locally, except for this one guy who uses <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv">rbenv</a> (which is a great tool, more on that in another blog post).</p>

<p>I have observed people use different strategies and workflows with bundler and RVM, since there is at least one overlap in what they do: manage collections of rubygems.
Bundler calles them <em>bundles</em> and RVM calles them <em>gemsets</em>.</p>

<p>Broadly, here are two patterns.</p>

<h3>Pattern #1</h3>

<p>When a new project is cloned or intialized, an RVM gemset is created with the project&#8217;s name.
Then, every time one wishes to work on that project, they switch to that gemset using the .rvmrc.</p>

<h3>Pattern #2</h3>

<p>When cloning or initilizing a new project on the system, no gemsets are explicitly created in RVM.
Instead, bundler is used to manage all gemmy things across the system and across projects.</p>

<p><code>bundle install --path .gems</code></p>

<p>This <code>--path</code> helps keeping the global RVM gem-space always empty (except for bundler.gem, rake.gem and rails.gem, to initlialize new projects.)
This also results in one&#8217;s <code>.bundle/config</code> file to now contain the entry</p>

<p><code>BUNDLE\_PATH: .gems</code></p>

<p>And of course, .gems should be ignored by your SCM.</p>

<p><code>echo ".gems" \&gt;\&gt; .gitignore \# if you use git.</code></p>

<p><em><strong>protip:</strong> I also include .gems when I create my tagfile. This helps me to quickly jump into the gem&#8217;s codebase using my editor.</em></p>

<h3>Why do I shamelessly try selling Pattern #2 to everyone I meet?</h3>

<p>Bundler is closer to the project while RVM is closer to the system. I like to have my project&#8217;s gems in my project&#8217;s directory managed with a tool built for the job.</p>

<p>Bundler stays with you in production.env while RVM might not, depending on the sysadmin and the situation at hand. I uniformly work on a philosophy of keeping my development as close to production with regards to the toolchain. No, I don&#8217;t run RHEL on my laptop.</p>

<p>One additional step encountered is prefixing every command that needs to run in the project context by <code>bundle exec</code> (I have it aliased to <code>bx</code>).
Which is only fair, since that is how every command would run on production.env.</p>

<p>e. g. <code>bundle exec rake db:migrate</code> or <code>bx rails dbconsole</code></p>

<p><em><strong>protip:</strong> Forgot to prefix <code>bx</code> to the previous command? Run <code>bx !!</code>.</em></p>

<p>UPDATE: @tdinkar <a href="https://twitter.com/tdinkar/status/126517974759776256">pointed me</a> to passing the <code>--binstubs</code> flag to bundle install that gets rid of having to use <code>bundle exec</code> for every executable command to be run in the bundled context.
Here is Yehuda&#8217;s <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2011/05/30/gem-versioning-and-bundler-doing-it-right/">blog post</a> delving into more detail about the <code>--binstubs</code> flag and the reason for its existence.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>It started with SSH sessions to the Bangalore data center freezeing up sporadically.</h3>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t all that sporadic, a pattern was noticed soon enough &#8211; a
harmless <code>C-x C-s</code> issued when inside vi.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, most distros do not come bundled with emacs and I have to resort to botching up and fumbling with vi (or vim) to edit a few configurations now and then.
Everytime I&#8217;d tweak an LXC configuration with vim and hit <code>C-x C-s</code> on the unsuspecting editor, things would freeze up. It&#8217;d refuse to respond to even the widely respected un-interceptability of the <code>^Z</code>.
Since I use a multiplexed SSH control-master, I&#8217;d waste no time opening another SSH to the obstinate host in a different tab and mind my business.</p>

<p>Till I learned about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Software_flow_control&amp;oldid=442424622" title="flow control">flow control</a>.</p>

<h3>What is software flow control?</h3>

<p>Software Flow Control enables communication links to be started or
stopped using the primary communication channel, which in this case
was the ssh tunnel.
XON and XOFF dictate the status of the data-link transmission to the
tty <em>(X stands for transmission)</em>.</p>

<p>XOFF is mapped to <code>C-s</code> by default, which causes the SSH session to not receive any signals.</p>

<p>It can be promptly remedied by an XON (mapped to <code>C-q</code> by default) to resume the transmission.</p>

<p>Emacs by default intercepts all <code>C-</code> sequences and hence does not exhibit this behaviour.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>
SSH freezes up, &#8216;hangs&#8217; or stops responding when you hit <code>C-s</code>?
Use <code>C-q</code> to resume it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Presented earlier this year in January 2011, Chris Breisemeister put forth a few practices that we follow
when working with a variety of large enterprise clients on software delivery and enablement.</p>

<p>We start right from the basics of what lifecycle does a line of code typically follow to how
different environments should be configured and managed.</p>

<p>Since we talked to a Ruby audience, we talk specifically about release practices and workflows of
Ruby on Rails applications centered around Continuous Integration that have enabled us to deploy extremely fast.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.twitter.com/ajeygore">@AjeyGore</a> and I presented deployment patterns and paradigms that we&#8217;ve observed and influenced while consulting and enabling numerous clients.</p>

<p>The ones at the beginning are ideal for smaller scale applications that do not typically need to scale fast.
We also go on to talk on more advanced patterns by using system-level
packing tools that can enable an application to scale very rapidly if
you use Chef or Puppet.</p>

<p>We presented this at DevOpsDays Bangalore 2011.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a followup from the lightning talk <strong>5 Time Saving Bash
Tricks</strong> that I gave at DevOpsDays, Bangalore 2011.</p>

<h3>SSH multiplexing</h3>

<p>Adding these to <code>~/.ssh/config</code> or <code>/etc/ssh_config</code> will allow you to
multiplex one SSH connection to open multiple terminals, multiple
<code>scp</code> and <code>git push</code> without having to authenticate over keys or passwords.</p>

<pre><code>Host \*
ControlMaster auto
ControlPath /tmp/%r0%h:%p
</code></pre>

<h3>Ensuring Bash Hisory across multiple sessions</h3>

<p>Add this to <code>~/.bashrc</code></p>

<pre><code>shopt -s histappend
</code></pre>

<h3>The rabbit hole of directories</h3>

<p>Remember to use <code>pushd</code> and <code>popd</code> when in deeply working with many
directories.</p>

<pre><code>grizzly:~$ pushd /var/log/apache2/
/var/log/apache2 ~
grizzly:apache2$ # do something
grizzly:apache2$ pushd /etc
/etc /var/log/apache2 ~
grizzly:etc$ # do something else
grizzly:etc$ popd
/var/log/apache2 ~
grizzly:apache2$ popd
~
grizzly:~$
</code></pre>

<p>In fact, you can effectively use <code>pushd</code> instead of <code>cd</code>.</p>

<h3>Background tail processes to share STDOUT and STDERR with any REPL</h3>

<pre><code>tail -f httpd.log &amp;
</code></pre>

<p>Then start the REPL, or continue working on the shell (which is also a
REPL).</p>

<h3>And finally, some copypasta on the Shell</h3>

<p><em>Note that these work with the emacs-readline, which is the default
 configuration in most distributions (including OS X).</em></p>
